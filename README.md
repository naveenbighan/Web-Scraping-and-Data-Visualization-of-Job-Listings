# project data Anaylisis of Job listing

Data Cleaning & Processing: used pandas to clean and manipulate the data from a CSV file containing job information. You standardized the company names, handled missing values, and split skills into a more structured format.

Skill Extraction: Using spaCy and its PhraseMatcher tool, you built a skill extraction system. A predefined list of skills was used to match and extract skills from the job descriptions (Requirements column) and stored them in a new column.

Visualization: created several visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to display common job titles, companies with the most listings, and the most in-demand skills.

Saving Results: You exported the cleaned and analyzed data into CSV and Excel files, and saved graphs as PNG files.
